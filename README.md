Hello Coders & Mentors!!

Welcome to my new reprosatory which is a project I worked while learning the python language. If you just entered in the mouth of the python, you are going to learn atleast one new thing through this code. 

If you are in midist of python's belly, you must guide this little panda to make a continual improvement, however Condemnation are always welcome.

# About the Voice-Assistant
I named this voice-assistant "Passeridae" which means sparrow as I always wanted to have a conversation with my little sparrow of my home from childhood.

Passeridae is a python oriented app/project that uses speech recognition and text-to-speech to perform arithmentic and logical tasks. Earlier app used the Google text-to-speech API, but has been updated to use offline text-to-speech with pyttsx3

### Dependencies

pip install speechrecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install pyaudio
pip install playsound
pip install PyObjC


pip install PyAudio

(If there is a issue in installing PyAudio use .whl file from this link [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio))  

### Voice Commands

You are always welcome to add few more commands for this little project, but I would to introduce some of the existing ones.

   - What is your name?
   - What is my exact location?
   - Play music
   - Search on YouTube, Wikipedia, Google
   - What time is it
   - Save a Note
   - **Send Email
   - Toss Head/Tail
   - Take Screenshot
   - Check weather
   - Exit

(** You have to allow "Less-secure sign-in method", in order to send email. )

### Apple Mac OS X (Homebrew & PyAudio)
Use Homebrew to install the prerequisite portaudio library, then install PyAudio using pip:

`brew install portaudio`
`pip install pyaudio`

Notes:

If not already installed, download Homebrew.
pip will download the PyAudio source and build it for your version of Python.
Homebrew and building PyAudio also require installing the Command Line Tools for Xcode (more information).
